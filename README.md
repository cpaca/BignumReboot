# BignumReboot
My submissions for the Bignum Bakeoff Reboot. The code in here is bad. I've commented it, but there's still quite a few optimizations done because the original challenge maxed out at 512 characters.

Also, I did all of my work on my local computer until I had the finished version. Terrible practice; don't do that for a real program.
